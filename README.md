An application to track employees by role and department. To start this application the user needs to open the integrated terminal and use the command npm i so that the node modules can be installed along with the dependencies needed for the program to run and function mysql, inquirer, and console.table. After this is done copy the schema from the schema.sql and open the MySQl workbench and paste it into the workbench run the commands this will create the tables needed for the application. Once that is done delete the schema commands from the workbench copy the contents of the seeds.sql and paste this into the workbench run the commands and this will insert the data needed for the application to run into the tables. The commands to check and see the data are located at the bottom of the seeds file use these to check to see if the data has been created in the tables. Next in the index.js be sure to update the username, password, and port for your workbench as your username and password will be different the port might be the same for the workbench. This is also commented in the respective areas in the index.js file. Once all this is completed open the index.js in the integrated terminal and run the command node index.js and the application will prompt you with a listed question to choose a task. Choose from the choices and the application will continue to prompt based on what task you would like to complete. 

Above are the criteria needed to meet requirements of this assignment these are met based on what tasks are chosen with the questions. 

# Lessons:

This assignment allowed me to work with MySQL which is the first time I have used this application and database. It was challenging because the MySQL workbench is a somewhat hard to work with at one point I started a new database because my previous one had som many errors that I could not get it to work it was just easier to start clean and create a new DB to run the application from. A great lesson from this assignment is connecting the MySQL tables together using set commands. Also using the console.table package from node that formatted the tables in the terminal so they would be much easier to read this was also a great resource to have. Connecting a database with terminal allowed me another experience in working with the backend web development and not having the frontend. This showed me another side to the full stack web development. 

# Takeaways: 

This assignment gave me more experience with inquirer and all its capabilities also utilizing another tool on node called console.table. This was a new tool that I had never worked with before. MySQL is a great tool used to create, store, and access data. It can be used in so many ways as it was in this application or like in the class activities where a list of 5,000 songs were imported and categorized based on parameters we had set for it. Bringing these two assets together has shown me yet another way I can utilize all the tools that are available to a full stack web developer.
